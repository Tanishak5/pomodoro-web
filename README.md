# ‚è≥ Pomodoro Timer Website

A simple yet engaging Pomodoro timer website designed to help users stay productive while enjoying multiple visual themes.  
This project not only provides a clean, functional timer, but also served as a refresher for my web development fundamentals.
Designed in Figma.

## Future
- I plan to edit this into a simple desktop app, that opens the pomodoro as a widget. Also, the idea is to make the image a widget to act as a "study buddy".
- "Study buddy" will complete a task whilst the timer runs - allowing me to practise pixel art, since the art on this website is from pinterest of ai.
- I also plan to convert some of this into a full stack habit tracking/to do list app in the style of a personal journal.
