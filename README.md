# ⏳ Pomodoro Timer Website

An ngaging Pomodoro timer website (now with added to-do list functionality) designed to help users stay productive while enjoying multiple visual themes.  
This project not only provides a clean, functional timer, but also served as a refresher for my web development fundamentals.
Designed in Figma.

## ✨ Features
- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focus sessions with longer study, short break. The Focus session is **customizable** and the app **adjusts** the **break** period accordingly.

- **To-do List**: Persistend task-storage to-do list, to allow users one space for their productive sessions. Backend made in Flask.

- Revisit **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** basics.
- Practice **DOM manipulation** and event handling.
- Learn how to manage **state** in a web app (timer start/stop/reset).
- Experiment with **CSS themes** and dynamic class switching.
- First experience with **Backend Engineering** via **Flask**.

## Future
- I plan to edit this into a simple desktop app, that opens the pomodoro as a widget. Also, the idea is to make the image a widget to act as a "study buddy". Half Done
- "Study buddy" will complete a task whilst the timer runs - allowing me to practise pixel art, since the art on this website is from pinterest of ai.
- I also plan to convert some of this into a full stack habit tracking/to do list app in the style of a personal journal. Done
